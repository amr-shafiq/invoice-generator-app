## **Installation**

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter**: Install Flutter from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
- **Firebase CLI**: Install Firebase CLI for authentication features.
- **Supabase Account**: Create an account on [Supabase](https://supabase.io) to use their database and storage services.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amr-shafiq/invoice-generator-app.git
    cd invoice-generator-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Configure Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console.
   - Enable Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In.
   - Follow the steps to download the `google-services.json` and place it in your projectâ€™s `android/app` folder.

4. **Configure Supabase**:
   - Create a Supabase account and set up a new project.
   - Add your Supabase URL and Anonymous Key to your `.env` file.

    Example `.env` file:
    ```plaintext
    SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
    ```
5. **Configure Invoice PDF layout**:
   - Once the setup is complete, attach an invoice file (PDF format) into the `assets` folder. Include editable text fields (This project will not work without them!) of the details that needs to be filled up by users. And then edit the property values of each text field once the invoice file has been inserted. Be sure to edit the values as well in these files; `lib/add_pdf_page.dart` and `lib/add_pdf_page_management.dart`.
   - Do note that this project is only used for invoice generation among agents and management used in a travel agency. If this project is used by anything else, then these file may need to be changed entirely (To fit the use case requirement).
   - Change the text field values whenever necessary (If the invoice layout does not match with the default text value as shown in here). It is around the lines like this:
     ```plaintext
     final Map<String, dynamic> fields = {
      "CUSTOMER_NAME": customerName,
      "INVOICE_NO": invoiceNo,
      "DATE": formattedInvoiceDate,
      "BANK_TRANSFER": formattedBankTransfer,
      "HOTEL_NAME": hotel,
      "ROOM_TYPE": roomType,
      "CHECK_IN": formattedCheckInDate,
      "CHECK_OUT": formattedCheckOutDate,
      "ROOM_RATE": roomRate,
      "BREAKFAST_OR_NO": breakfast,
      "QUANTITY": quantityRoom.toString(),
      "BALANCE_DUE": balanceDue.toString(),
      "AMOUNT": amount.toString(),
      "AGENT_NAME": agentName,
      "TOTAL": totalAmount.toString(),
      "PAYMENT": payment.toString(),
      "BALANCE": balance.toString(),
      "BOOKING_NO": bookingNo ?? "Pending Verification",
      "DATELINE": formattedDateline,
      "ADD_ON": addOn,
      "REMARKS": remarks,
    };
     ```

6. **Run the app**:
   - Once the setup is complete, run the app using:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
